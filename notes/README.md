This folder contains all personal notes related to this project. All files in this folder should be Markdown files with the `.md` extension.

Additionally, it is highly recommended that [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is used to create these files, tag them, and manage them. The `.obsidian` directory contains preferences related to the Obsidian graphical user interface, and will be loaded automatically if the current `notes` directory is opened in Obsidian as a vault.

The `example.md` file describes an example Markdown file that was created using Obsidian.

All PDF files related to this project should **not** be kept in the `notes` directory. Instead, these PDF files should be stored under an appropriate collection (or subcollection) inside [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). Like Obsidian, Zotero allows you to tag PDFs to be able to search and filter through them at different times.
