# Template for Python projects

This repository contains a template that I use for personal projects written in Python. For context, these projects are often oriented towards research, especially research which involves the use of different types of data (images, audio, video, csv files, etc.). This template makes use of [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package and environment management.

## Structure

The following is a brief description of each top-level directory in this repository.

### `src`

The `src` directory contains all the Python code written for this project. For more information on this directory, see [its README file](src/README.md).

### `notes`

In any research project, one will often need to write down personal notes related to the research being conducted. This is what the `notes` directory is used for. For more information on this directory, see [its README file](notes/README.md).

### `data`

The `data` directory contains all the file types that do not belong in the `src` and `notes` directories. This includes images, audio files, videos, large csv files, etc. For more information on this directory, see [its README file](data/README.md).
