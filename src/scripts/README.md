This directory contains all Python scripts related to this project. Each Python script optionally makes use of the functions and classes inside the [`../local_lib/local_lib`](../local_lib/local_lib/) directory. The `hello_world.py` file in this directory shows an example of how to use these functions and classes. To ensure that each Python script has the same working directory, each Python script should be run from inside the [`../../src`](../../src/) directory.
